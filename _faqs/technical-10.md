title: Which browsers are supported?
categories: [technical]

ProjectForge is developed and tested with Apple Safari, Firefox and Chrome. These browsers should work fine in their current version. The Microsoft Internet Explorer doesn't work with all versions of ProjectForge because it's very time-consuming to develop a version that work well with the IE. The IE is so much different to all other browsers... The use of __Firefox__ or __Google Chrome__ is recommended.
