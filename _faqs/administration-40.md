title: Hypersonic: Could not insert entries to the data base.
categories: [administration]
---

If the user can't add new entries (contracts, Gantt charts, MEB entries etc.) to the data-base Hypersonic, please have a look in your ProjectForgeDB.script file. All create-table-statements should have the following entry for the primary key (pk): 
`CREATE MEMORY TABLE T_...(PK INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY(START WITH 1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, ...` 
If the script doesn't contain `GENERATED BY DEFAULT ...`, please stop your ProjectForge system and edit the script file and restart ProjectForge.
