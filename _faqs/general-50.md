title: Problems with the orderbook for users in the Pf_ProjectManager group
categories: [general]
---


Under certain circumstances, a user of the PF_ProjectManager group can not see the order book, although this should always be the case by a user in the PF_ProjectManager group.

__Workaround:__

- Add users to the PF_ProjectAssistant group and remove them from the PF_ProjectManager group and save it.
- Then select the empty value from the jobbook drop-down menu and save it.
- Now add the user to the group PF_ProjectManager and remove them from the PF_ProjectAssistant group and save it.
