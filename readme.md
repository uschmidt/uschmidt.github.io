# Micromata Weihnachtsbotschaft 2021

Now without all the bloat :)

## Usage

This sections describes how to use this repo.

### Prerequisites

1. Ruby 3.0.x
  - I highly recommend you install ruby using [rvm](https://rvm.io/)!
2. Bundler & Jekyll
  - Can be installed using: `gem install bundler jekyll`
3. Node >= 14 (or 12, it's not *that* important for this)

### Dependencies

This project uses two dependency management systems:
- Bundler for Jekyll plugins
- NPM for frontend dependencies

#### Bundler

Bundler dependencies can be installed by running:
```shell
bundle install
```

On macOS, there might be an error when  building the `eventmachine` dependency because of openssl. 
This can be solved by installing openssl and then pointing bundler to the correct location:

```shell
brew install openssl
gem install eventmachine -v '1.2.7' --source 'https://rubygems.org/' -- --with-cppflags=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
```

#### NPM

NPM dependencies can be installed by running:
```shell
npm install
```

Run the following to generate your site:
```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Development

To develop the site using livereload and extensive error reports, run the following:
```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --trace
```

### Prod build

A prod build can be generated by running the following:
```shell
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
```

You then find the generated site in `/_site`.
