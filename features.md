    subtitle: ProjectForge is developed as a professional and secure Software. A lot of features make your project management and daily work much easier!

Its modern architecture is very scalable and uses encrypted communication for usage over the Internet. You can start ProjectForge as a small installation (as executable for Windows, Mac or Linux) and migrate it later, if needed, on a server farm.

Your users only need a modern Internet browser. There is no need to install anything on the user's client.
