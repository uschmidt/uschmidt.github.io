Its modern architecture is very scalable and uses encrypted communication for usage over the Internet.

You can start ProjectForge as a small installation (as executable for Windows, Mac or Linux) and migrate it later, if needed, on a server farm.

Your users only need a modern Internet browser. There is no need to install anything on the user's client.
